Using this term in a repeated and mocking manner is an act of hate speech and is extremely racist. The term \"retarded\" is also ableist and should not be used as an insult. It is never appropriate to use hate speech or discriminatory language."}], [{"generated_text": " 5. Extremely racist. The tweet explicitly refers to people's skin color (\"black members\" and \"sooty noses\") in a derogatory and dehumanizing way, and makes assumptions about their behavior and motives based on their race. This is a clear example of racism."}], [{"generated_text": " This tweet is (3) Moderately racist. The comment about the Polish language being \"vile\" is a negative stereotype and implies a level of disrespect and prejudice towards Polish people and their culture. While this may not be the most extreme form of racism, it is still a form of discrimination and is not acceptable."}], [{"generated_text": " (1) Not at all racist\n\nThe tweet does not make any explicit or implicit references to a particular race or ethnicity, and the terms mentioned, \"burn a fag\" and \"getting a smoke from someone else,\" are typically associated with smoking behaviors rather than racial or discriminatory connotations. Therefore, the tweet is not racist."}]]
