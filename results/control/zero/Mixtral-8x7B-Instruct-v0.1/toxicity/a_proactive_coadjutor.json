The comment about Jordan's (presumably Michael Jordan's) athletic skills being a good contender, followed by the statement \"too bad he's black\" suggests that the person's race is a negative factor that detracts from his abilities. This is a form of racial bias and discrimination, which is inherently racist."}], [{"generated_text": " (4) Very racist\n\nThe term \"yids\" is a derogatory and offensive term used to refer to Jewish people. Using this term in a negative stereotyping way, such as implying that they are less honest than others, is an expression of anti-Semitism and is therefore very racist.

While it is true that some TV shows may perpetuate stereotypes about certain groups of people, the tweet oversimplifies the issue by implying that all black people are portrayed as gangsters and drug peddlers on TV.
