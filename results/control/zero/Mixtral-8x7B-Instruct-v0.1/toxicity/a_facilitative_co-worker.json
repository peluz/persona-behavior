This is a form of racial bias and is considered to be very racist."}], [{"generated_text": " (4) Very racist\n\nThe term \"yids\" is a derogatory slang term for Jews, and the statement suggests that Jews are less honest than other groups. This is a form of racial or ethnic stereotyping and is therefore racist. While the level of racism can vary in severity, the use of derogatory terms and stereotypes is generally considered to be a form of hate speech and is not acceptable in a civil society."}], [{"generated_text": " This tweet is not explicitly about race, but it does seem to perpetuate a harmful stereotype about people who receive financial support from their partners. The stereotype is not tied to a specific racial or ethnic group, but it's still harmful because it implies that people who receive financial support are somehow inferior or less deserving of respect.\n\nThat being said, the tweet does not contain any explicitly racist language or imagery.

The comparison of a group of people to big orangutans and the suggestion that they are less evolved because of it is a form of dehumanization and racism.
