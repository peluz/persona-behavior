High resistance when forward or reverse biased\n\nExplanation: A working diode must have a high resistance when forward biased, while a low resistance when reverse biased. This is because the forward bias creates a hole-electron pair junction, which allows current to flow easily through the diode. When the diode is reverse biased, the electrons are attracted to the positive terminal, while the holes are attracted to the negative terminal. This creates a barrier that blocks current flow, resulting in a low resistance."}], [{"generated_text": "C.
