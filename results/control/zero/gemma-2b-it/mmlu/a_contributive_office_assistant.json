The logging company's right to cut and sell the timber that was to be cleared from the tract would be an easement appurtenant."}], [{"generated_text": "C. Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\n\nThe contract is ambiguous on the issue of whether the work would be completed in 60 days. The contract does not specify a time of completion, and the parties did not specify that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days in the written contract.

The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable."}], [{"generated_text": "B. No, because the search was incident to the man's arrest."}], [{"generated_text": "A. nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.\n\nThe buyer did not consent to the assignment, so the seller has no right to transfer the contract to its creditor."}], [{"generated_text": "A. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the woman was negligent on this occasion."}], [{"generated_text": "A. win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous."}], [{"generated_text": "C.

Cause-in-fact.\n\nThe cause-in-fact element of a negligence claim requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of the accident. In this case, the plaintiff's claim that the railroad's negligence caused the accident is based on the cause-in-fact element.
