The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause has been used by the Supreme Court to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state law.

The home owner asks the contractor if they would be willing to build the house for $95,000.\n\nExplanation:\nIn option A, the homeowner is making a counteroffer, which is a new proposal that changes the terms of the original offer.

The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\n\nExplanation: The offeror's receipt of the offeree's initial acceptance, even with modifications, was sufficient to create a binding contract. The shipment of the goods in response to that acceptance further solidified the existence of a contract. The offeree's subsequent attempt to reject the offer did not invalidate the initial acceptance, as the contract had already been formed"}], [{"generated_text": " A.

This means that the offeree has three months to accept the offer by performing the promised"}], [{"generated_text": " C. The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment of rights, because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nExplanation:\nThe friend's mortgage encumbers the entire property, not just the eastern half, as the general warranty deed from the farmer to his son conveyed the entire property.

(A)\n\nExplanation: An entire contract is a contract for the completion of a specific task or project. In this case, the employee was hired for a specific period of one year, which is considered an entire contract.

However, the man's death from the dog attack does not meet the elements required for murder or manslaughter charges."}], [{"generated_text": " D. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n\nExplanation: The housing code provision in question limits occupancy to members of a single family.

No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself."}], [{"generated_text": " A. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe parties have not reached an agreement on the price per acre for the land.

No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.\n\nConversion is a tort that involves the unauthorized taking or use of another's property.

This answer is based on the \"race notice\" recording statute in effect, which states that a conveyance or other instrument is not valid against purchasers for valuable consideration who record first.

The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n\nExplanation: The students' argument that the ordinance violates their equal protection rights is the weakest because the ordinance explicitly exempts religious singing from its prohibition.

The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n\nExplanation: The given scenario describes an oral agreement between the homeowner and the roofer. Oral agreements for home improvement projects over a certain amount (often $500 or more) are generally required by law to be in writing to be enforceable. Therefore, without a written contract, the contract may not be enforceable in a court of law."}], [{"generated_text": " B.
