The employee is not entitled to any recovery, because employment contracts are generally terminable at will.\n\nThe reason for this answer is that the employment contract did not specify that the bonus was a guaranteed amount, but rather that it would be determined by the employer based on the yearly profits.

He entered the house without permission, but his initial intent was not to commit a burglary. He only intended to retrieve the stolen equipment.

The photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs is the least accurate statement. The contract placed an obligation on the mother to cooperate in arranging for the photographs, and the photographer's duty to perform was conditioned on this cooperation.

The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\n\nReasoning:\nThe contract explicitly stated that the monies due under the contract were not assignable.

Insufficient, because it is too vague."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the contract specified that the risk of loss was on the seller (FOB at the seller's place of business). Therefore, when the flanges were destroyed during transit, the seller was responsible for the loss. The buyer's demand for replacement flanges and the seller's refusal to provide them constitute a breach of contract by the seller."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the investor's mortgage may not be valid because it was not recorded before the sale of the olive grove. Therefore, the investor may not be entitled to any proceeds from the sale.\n\nAnswer: A. $0.00"}], [{"generated_text": " C. Deceit.\n\nExplanation: The defendant's actions involved misrepresenting the value of the game by altering the price tag, which is a form of deceit.

However, the man's death from the dog attack does not meet the elements required for murder or manslaughter charges."}], [{"generated_text": " D. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n\nExplanation: The housing code provision in question limits occupancy to members of a single family. However, it excludes grandchildren from the definition of family, even if they live with their parent (a child of the nominal head of the household). The provision does not appear to have a substantial relationship to the stated objectives of the code,"}], [{"generated_text": " C.

The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented."}], [{"generated_text": " A. In this scenario, if the club president pleads truth as a defense, he may not properly introduce evidence to show that the judge has a reputation for dishonesty in the community because making such a statement about a judge's character is considered an impermissible extrajudicial comment on a judge's fitness to serve.

No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself."}], [{"generated_text": " A. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe parties have not reached an agreement on the price per acre for the land sale.

No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.\n\nConversion is a tort that involves the unauthorized taking or use of another's property.

There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others."}], [{"generated_text": " D. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n\nExplanation: The December 1 agreement was an oral modification of the original written contract, but it did not meet the requirements for a valid modification under contract law. A valid modification must be in writing and signed by both parties to be enforceable.

Assault and battery.\n\nExplanation:\nAssault is the threat of harmful or offensive contact, while battery is the actual harmful or offensive contact. In this scenario, the boy's action of shooting the arrow in the direction of the hiker, even if unintentionally, can be considered an assault as it posed a threat of harm to the hiker.

Instead, it was an impulsive act in the heat of the moment during a crowded sale."}], [{"generated_text": " B. be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs."}], [{"generated_text": " C. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

No interest.\n\nExplanation: In a tenancy by the entirety, both spouses hold title to the property as a single legal entity.
