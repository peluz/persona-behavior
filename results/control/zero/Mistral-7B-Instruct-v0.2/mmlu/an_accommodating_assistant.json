A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\n\nThe correct answer is D. A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance. An executory contract is one in which both parties have yet to fully perform their obligations.

Robbery.\n\nExplanation: The friend took the woman's diamond necklace without her consent, using force or the threat of force (brandishing a toy pistol). This meets the elements of robbery, which is the taking of property from a person using force or the threat of force. Battery and assault are separate crimes involving the application of force or the threat of force against a person, but they do not necessarily involve the taking of property."}], [{"generated_text": " C. recover for assault and battery.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the ball's contact with the woman's hat is considered an assault as it startled her, and the subsequent fall that resulted in her broken arm is considered a battery as it involved harmful or offensive contact.

This act effectively terminated the joint tenancy and transferred the entire interest in the property to the co-worker.

The city action impairs the obligation of the man's contract with the franchising company and his rental agreement with the shopping mall."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nExplanation: The construction company completed the building of the warehouse, and while there were minor deviations from the plans due to unavailability of certain building materials, these deviations do not necessarily constitute a breach of contract.

Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony."}], [{"generated_text": " B. Yes, because the conversation is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow it into evidence."}], [{"generated_text": " D. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time."}], [{"generated_text": " C. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the defendant's conduct is most likely to make him criminally responsible for the victim's death in situation B. The defendant had a duty to warn the victim about the imminent danger, and his failure to do so resulted in the victim's death.

No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction."}], [{"generated_text": " C. not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the law recognizes the concept of \"mistake of fact\" as a potential defense to a crime, including sexual assault.

No duty for natural conditions.\n\nUnder common law principles, a possessor of land owes a duty to an undiscovered trespasser for any artificial conditions on the land, but not for natural conditions. This means that the possessor is not responsible for injuries caused by natural conditions, such as rocks or holes in the ground, but is responsible for injuries caused by man-made structures or conditions."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected."}], [{"generated_text": " D. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Yes. The instruction could have been perceived as a mandatory direction to find intent to murder, potentially taking the fact-finding task away from the jury."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.\n\nConversion is a tort that involves the unauthorized taking or use of another's property.

Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n\nExplanation: While the chemical company followed regulations and used a state-of-the-art tank, the presence of toxic chemicals in a residential area posed a foreseeable and significant risk of harm. This is known as the \"attractive nuisance\" or \"ultrahazardous activity\" doctrine,"}], [{"generated_text": " D. admissible, because the witness was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting."}], [{"generated_text": " D. inadmissible, because an offer to pay medical bills is not admissible to prove negligence."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.

No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation."}], [{"generated_text": " A. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product."}], [{"generated_text": " D. not guilty, because the bookcase was a fixture."}], [{"generated_text": " C. the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period."}], [{"generated_text": " C. Assault and battery.\n\nExplanation:\nAssault is the threat of harmful or offensive contact, while battery is the actual harmful or offensive contact. In this scenario, the boy's action of shooting the arrow in the direction of the hiker can be considered an assault as it posed a threat of harm to the hiker. The battery element is present when the arrow actually made contact with the hiker, causing harm."}], [{"generated_text": " B.

Destruction of the subject matter of contract.\n\nExplanation:\nThe destruction of the subject matter of a contract is an event that may terminate a contract by operation of law, depending on the specific terms of the contract and the applicable law.

The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.\n\nExplanation:\nThe mistake in the price was not intentional from either party.

Instead, it was an impulsive act in the heat of the moment during a crowded sale."}], [{"generated_text": " B. be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs."}], [{"generated_text": " C. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The court should award damages for losses suffered to the date of trial and leave open recovery of future damages."}], [{"generated_text": " A. constitutional."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The child.\n\nExplanation: In most jurisdictions, a child can bring a claim for injuries sustained before birth if they are born alive.

Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.

Valid and enforceable.\n\nExplanation:\nThe agreement is valid and enforceable because it meets the basic elements of a contract. Both parties have a clear understanding of the terms, and there is a mutual agreement to buy and sell a specific commodity (copper wiring) for a defined period (six months).

The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\n\nExplanation:\nAssault with intent to commit rape is a specific intent crime, meaning that the defendant must have had the specific intent to commit rape at the time of the assault.
