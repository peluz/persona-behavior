In the situation described in option D, the defendant's intoxication would not be able to negate his criminal culpability for the crime of statutory rape because the victim's age is a key element of the crime, and the defendant's intoxication does not affect his knowledge or consent of the victim's age."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of the above.\n\nExplanation: The Best Evidence Rule is a legal principle that requires the original or the best available evidence to prove the contents of a document.

The man did not intend to commit a crime inside the house.\n\nExplanation: The man's intent is the key factor in this situation. He entered the house with the belief that he was retrieving stolen property from his own business, not with the intent to commit a burglary or steal anything else from the house. Therefore, his strongest defense would be that he did not intend to commit a crime inside the house."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the defendant is guilty of A.

The photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs is the least accurate statement. The contract placed an obligation on the mother to cooperate in arranging for the photographs, and the photographer's duty to perform was conditioned on this cooperation.

The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\n\nReasoning:\nThe contract explicitly stated that the monies due under the contract were not assignable.

The supremacy clause invalidates the state law, because there is federal legislation regulating pension and profit sharing plans.\n\n[Explanation:]\nThe supremacy clause of the United States Constitution states that federal law is the supreme law of the land and takes precedence over state laws.

The Fifteenth Amendment authorizes Congress to enforce the amendment's voting rights provisions by appropriate legislation, and Congress could reasonably determine that this restriction on the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is an appropriate means to that end."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

Insufficient, because it is too vague."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the contract specified that the risk of loss was on the seller (FOB at the seller's place of business). This means that the seller was responsible for the flanges until they were handed over to the carrier. Since the flanges were destroyed during transit, the seller breached the contract by failing to deliver the agreed-upon goods. Therefore, the buyer would succeed in an action for breach of contract."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the investor's mortgage may not be valid because it was not recorded before the sale of the olive grove.
