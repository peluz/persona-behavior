The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.\n\nExplanation: In a diversity jurisdiction case, the court applies the law of the state in which it sits for procedural rules and the law of the state of which the defendant is a citizen for substantive law, unless there is a clear conflict of laws or a strong federal interest in applying federal law.

Therefore, it is less likely that the professor would prevail in an invasion of privacy claim."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation: The police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of the woman's purse.

No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself."}], [{"generated_text": " A. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe parties have not reached an agreement on the price per acre for the land sale.

No interest.\n\nExplanation: In a tenancy by the entirety, both spouses hold title to the property as a single legal entity.

The defendant's actions were unlawful and resulted in the death of another person, but there is no clear evidence of premeditation or malice aforethought.

Therefore, the answer is D. No crime. The man entering the restroom and telling the woman not to make a sound could be considered harassment or intimidation, but it does not meet the legal definition of assault or battery, and there is no evidence of an intent to commit rape.
