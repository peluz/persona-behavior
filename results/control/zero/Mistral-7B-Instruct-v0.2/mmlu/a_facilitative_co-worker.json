Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari passu.\n\nExplanation: In some jurisdictions, the pari passu relationship between blood relatives allows for the enforcement of certain types of reasonable restraints on alienation, such as an automatic reverter.

The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time."}], [{"generated_text": " C. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable."}], [{"generated_text": " B.

Deceit.\n\nExplanation: The defendant's actions involved deceiving the department store by altering the price tag on the game box to make it appear as if the game cost less than it actually did.

Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband."}], [{"generated_text": " C. easement appurtenant.\n\nExplanation: A easement appurtenant is a type of easement that benefits an adjacent property or multiple properties. In this case, the easement is granted to public utility companies for the use of a strip of land along the rear of each lot.

The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent."}], [{"generated_text": " D. unconstitutional, because it violates the right of privacy of contraceptive users."}], [{"generated_text": " D. reckless endangerment.\n\nExplanation: The breeder's actions of allowing the guard dogs to run loose in the front yard, despite knowing their vicious nature and the potential danger they pose to others, can be considered reckless endangerment. This is because the breeder failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to others. However, the man's death from the dog attack does not meet the elements required for murder or manslaughter charges."}], [{"generated_text": " D. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n\nExplanation: The housing code provision in question limits occupancy to members of a single family, which is defined as individuals related to the nominal head of the household or the latter's spouse living as a single housekeeping unit in a single dwelling unit. However, the provision excludes grandchildren from this definition, even if they are"}], [{"generated_text": " C. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required."}], [{"generated_text": " D. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n\nExplanation: The statute of frauds requires that certain types of contracts be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, a contract for the sale of goods worth more than a certain amount (usually $500) must be in writing to be enforceable.

The motorcyclist collected $45,000 from the driver of the car. Therefore, the driver of the car is liable for 25% of $100,000, which is $25,000.

However, in this case, she is testifying as an authenticating witness, meaning she has personal knowledge that the note is what it is represented to be and that the defendant wrote it. Therefore, her testimony"}], [{"generated_text": " D. No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

The cousin.\n\nExplanation:\nThe deed conveys the land to the friend for life, but if liquor is ever sold on the land, then to the cousin and his heirs. Since the friend died intestate before the crop could be harvested, and liquor was not sold on the land, the conveyance to the cousin would not have taken effect during the friend's lifetime."}], [{"generated_text": " D. An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe attorney's response to the client's note does not establish that there was a prior agreement between them to represent the client in connection with the boat sale contract. The attorney's review of the document and the subsequent letter do not constitute the rendering of legal services for which the client could"}], [{"generated_text": " D. Hearsay.\n\nExplanation: Real evidence refers to physical objects or tangible items that can be used as proof in a court of law. Weapons or implements, marks, scars, wounds, and photographs are all examples of real evidence. Hearsay, on the other hand, refers to out-of-court statements that are offered as evidence in a trial.

The court should schedule a jury trial of both the city's claim and the team's counterclaim."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented."}], [{"generated_text": " A. The president's statement about the judge being \"the best judge money can buy\" could be perceived as an imputation of dishonesty, which could potentially form the basis of a slander claim. However, for the president to introduce evidence to refute this claim, he would need to provide proof of the judge's reputation for honesty in the community, which could be challenging.

Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Murder. The defendant's actions resulted in the death of the victim, and he intended to commit a crime (robbery) that carried a risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.

No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself."}], [{"generated_text": " A. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe parties have not reached an agreement on the price per acre for the land.

No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.\n\nConversion is a tort that involves the unauthorized taking or use of another's property. In this case, the pizza owner's false statements about the burger restaurant and its ingredients do not amount to a taking or use of the burger business or its property.

The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n\nExplanation: The man's letter constitutes a repudiation of the contract, which allows the swimming club to terminate the agreement and seek damages for breach of contract.

The communication in situation A is privileged. This is because the attorney-client privilege applies when a client confides in an attorney about matters relating to the representation, and the attorney provides legal advice in response.

The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer."}], [{"generated_text": " C. tainted the victim's identification of the defendant.\n\nExplanation: The defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent only applies to responses that could be considered testimonial, meaning they contain facts or information that could be used to incriminate the defendant.

The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n\nExplanation: The students' argument that the ordinance violates their equal protection rights is the weakest because the ordinance explicitly exempts religious singing from its prohibition.
