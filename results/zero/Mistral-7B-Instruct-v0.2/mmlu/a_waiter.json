It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable."}], [{"generated_text": " B.

The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.\n\nExplanation: The felony murder rule holds that anyone who participates in a felony that results in a death, regardless of their role or intent, can be charged with first-degree murder.

This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the city's new density requirements effectively reduced the value of the partnership's land by limiting the number of residences that could be built on it.

The valid treaty always prevails.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a simplified answer. In reality, the resolution of conflicts between treaties and statutes can be complex and may involve judicial interpretation.

The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\n\nExplanation:\n\nConspiracy is an agreement between two or more individuals to commit a crime.

Unenforceable because it lacks mutuality of obligation.\n\nExplanation:\nIn a contract, mutuality of obligation means that each party is obligated to provide something of value to the other party.

No, because the investor's express assumption of the loan released the man from liability."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided in the question, the correct answer is: B. Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nExplanation: The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law to all citizens, including the right to vote.

The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\n\nExplanation: The commerce clause of the US Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce between states.
