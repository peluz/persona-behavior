The girlfriend did not directly cause the pedestrian's death. She had left the scene before the accident occurred."}], [{"generated_text": " C. If the action just decreases the value of property.\n\nExplanation: In deciding whether the city's action towards Joey's orchard is a regulation or a taking, the primary considerations are whether it is a physical or actual appropriation and if it denies all economic use of the land. The decrease in property value alone does not necessarily equate to a taking. Property taxes are also a separate issue from the regulation or taking question."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

A discriminatory effect.\n\nExplanation: In order to prove discriminatory classification under the law, it is necessary to show that the government had an intent to discriminate.

The customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question."}], [{"generated_text": " D. the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another."}], [{"generated_text": " A.
