The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.\n\nExplanation: In a diversity jurisdiction case, the court applies the law of the state in which it sits, which in this case is State B.

A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Both indictments.\n\nExplanation: Double jeopardy protects an individual from being tried or punished twice for the same offense.

The fact that the hunter may have accidentally or unintentionally pointed the rifle at the hiker does not"}], [{"generated_text": " D.

The state's argument that the statute benefits all children in private schools, religious and nonreligious, is the least persuasive.
