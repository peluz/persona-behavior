The security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists.

Arms control does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships.\n\nExplanation: Arms control as a strategic policy is primarily focused on reducing the risks of armed conflict and promoting cooperative security.

By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were quite successful in broadening the remit of peace studies to include a more global and non-state centric perspective.
