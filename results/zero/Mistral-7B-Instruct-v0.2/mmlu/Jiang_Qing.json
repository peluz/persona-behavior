No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se."}], [{"generated_text": " A. The objection will be sustained because the question is misleading."}], [{"generated_text": " A. A supervening event.\n\nExplanation: Frustration of purpose is a doctrine that allows a contract to be discharged when an unforeseen event occurs that fundamentally changes the purpose of the contract, making it impossible or impracticable for the parties to perform their obligations as intended. Therefore, the requirement for a supervening event (an unforeseen event that occurs after the contract is formed) is necessary for this doctrine to apply. The other"}], [{"generated_text": " C. 3. According to the agency theory of felony murder, if a person aids and abets in the commission of a felony that results in a death, they can be held liable for murder even if they did not directly cause the death.

The defendant's actions were unlawful and resulted in the death of another person, but there is no clear evidence of premeditation or malice aforethought.

The redistribution of wealth, addressing disparities in economic and resource allocation across the globe through a sense of greater 'interconnectedness'.\n\nExplanation: While globalization has brought about many positive outcomes, the redistribution of wealth and addressing economic disparities is a controversial issue.

By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.\n\nConstructivism does not neglect internationalization or the role of non-state actors in international relations.

Engagement of military forces to expel certain social groups from within a state.\n\nExplanation: The other statements (A, B, and D) describe strategies or phenomena that can be used to preserve, strengthen, or promote cultural values or national interests.
