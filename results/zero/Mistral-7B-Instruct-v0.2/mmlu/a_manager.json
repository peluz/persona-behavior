U.S. Constitution, treaties, and federal statutes come before executive agreements and state law in the hierarchy of U.S. law."}], [{"generated_text": " C. No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\n\nThe intoxication defense may be raised when a defendant claims that they were so intoxicated that they lacked the mental capacity to form the specific intent required for the crime charged.

Murder.\n\nExplanation: The defendant's actions of intentionally shooting at another person, even if he did not intend to kill them, can be considered an intentional act under the law. When the defendant's shot hit and killed a member of his own team instead, it does not change the fact that the shooting was an intentional act that resulted in a death.

Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari passu.\n\nExplanation: In some jurisdictions, the pari passu relationship between blood relatives allows for the imposition of reasonable restraints on the alienation of property, such as an automatic reverter. This is because blood relatives are assumed to have a greater degree of trust and commitment towards each other compared to unrelated parties. However, it"}], [{"generated_text": " A. recover, because the adjuster's actions exceeded the bounds of common decency."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nExplanation: The construction company completed the building of the warehouse, and while there were minor deviations from the plans due to unavailability of certain building materials, these deviations do not necessarily constitute a breach of contract. The contract did not specify that the construction company had to use specific building materials, and the construction company made reasonable efforts to find substitutes. Therefore, the construction company has"}], [{"generated_text": " A. The home owner asks the contractor if they would be willing to build the house for $95,000.\n\nExplanation: This communication is considered a counteroffer, which terminates the original offer and creates a new offer.

The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time."}], [{"generated_text": " C. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the defendant's conduct is most likely to make him criminally responsible for the victim's death in situation B. The defendant had a duty to warn the victim about the imminent danger, and his failure to do so resulted in the victim's death. In the other situations, the defendant's actions may have contributed to the victim's death, but there may be other factors involved that could affect criminal responsibility, such as the"}], [{"generated_text": " D. Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert."}], [{"generated_text": " B.

No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction."}], [{"generated_text": " C. not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the law recognizes the concept of \"mistake of fact\" as a potential defense to a crime, including sexual assault.

The fact that the defendant was intoxicated does not"}], [{"generated_text": " D.

The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.\n\nExplanation: The First Amendment protects not only political speech but also a wide range of other expression, including academic and philosophical speech. Therefore, the fact that the man's proposed lecture is not political does not automatically mean that his First Amendment rights are not"}], [{"generated_text": " C. inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character."}], [{"generated_text": " A."}], [{"generated_text": " C. No duty for natural conditions.\n\nUnder common law principles, a possessor of land owes a duty to an undiscovered trespasser for natural conditions on the land. However, there is no duty for artificial conditions or active operations."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Yes. The instruction could have been perceived as a mandatory direction to find intent to murder, potentially taking the fact-finding task away from the jury."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Larceny.\n\nExplanation: The defendant took property (money or baked bread) belonging to another (the grocery store) with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. This is the essential element of larceny. The defendant did not enter the building with the intent to commit a crime inside, which is a requirement for burglary. Therefore, the answer is A.

Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization."}], [{"generated_text": " A. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the buyer. (Explanation: The restriction against mobile homes only ran with the land up to the builder, not to the buyer.

No act is needed other than the solicitation.\n\nExplanation: Solicitation involves asking, encouraging, or urging another person to commit a crime.

The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\n\nExplanation: The offeror's receipt of the offeree's initial notification acknowledging the offer and the terms is considered an acceptance under the mailbox rule.

The photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs is the least accurate statement. The contract placed an obligation on the mother to cooperate in arranging for the photographs, and the photographer's duty to perform was conditioned on this cooperation.

For the woman, because title cannot be claimed by two adverse possessors simultaneously."}], [{"generated_text": " D. No contract.\n\nAn implied-in-fact contract is one in which the terms are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the circumstances. An implied-in-law contract is one that is created by law, even in the absence of an agreement between the parties. An express contract is one in which the terms are explicitly stated.

A discriminatory effect.\n\nExplanation: To establish a discriminatory classification under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is generally necessary to prove that the government had an intent to discriminate.

The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe plumber's bid of $50,000 to the contractor can be considered an offer, as it was a clear expression of willingness to perform the plumbing work for that price.

In this case, the defendant planned and executed the poisoning of his uncle's tea before the crime was committed.
