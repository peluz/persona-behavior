Fixed-route public transit routes increased in importance.\n\nExplanation: Suburbanization in the United States was largely driven by factors that made it easier for people to commute to urban areas for work, such as a shorter workweek, improved automobiles, and easier access to home mortgages.

This can lead to a more intense focus on those states and their voters, potentially leading to increased media attention and campaign resources being directed towards those areas"}], [{"generated_text": " D. Congress to nullify resolutions approved by the executive branch.\n\nExplanation: The legislative veto was a procedure that allowed Congress to nullify executive branch actions, including executive orders and regulations, by passing a joint resolution disapproving them.

By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.\n\nConstructivism does not neglect internationalization or the role of non-state actors in a globalized world.

Environmental changes pose new security challenges, such as food and water security, and can exacerbate existing conflicts.

The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n\nExplanation: The institutional innovation of security studies was facilitated by broader political considerations, particularly the need for a cohesive and strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political, and military planning in the context of the Cold War and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

An examination of the social processes by which groups of people construct something as a threat."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: The state can be both a provider of security and a threat to human security. It has the resources and power to protect its citizens, but it can also commit violent acts against them.

The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state."}], [{"generated_text": " C. Engagement of military forces to expel certain social groups from within a state.\n\nExplanation: A, B, and D are strategies or actions that can be employed by a state or society to strengthen or preserve cultural values, boost nationalist interests, or allow for self-determination, respectively.

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Post-Cold War developments have led to an increase in globalization, political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism, and a sharp increase in civil conflicts.

An increase in non-traditional security threats."}], [{"generated_text": " C. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Sovereignty, identity, and hegemonic ethnicity are all crucial aspects of societal security. Sovereignty refers to a state's political independence and control over its territory. Identity is the sense of belonging and distinctiveness of a group or individual. Hegemonic ethnicity refers to the dominant ethnic group in a society that shapes the cultural norms and values. All of these"}], [{"generated_text": " C. Neoliberal based adjustment policies have caused great and unnecessary hardship in developing countries and there is still no evidence they achieved their objectives for macroeconomic stability and growth.

I can attest to the hardships they caused.)"}], [{"generated_text": " C. Trade\n\nExplanation: Economic tools of security policy include sanctions, diplomacy, and aid.

Realism is defined by the belief that the behaviour of states constructs the international arena and that this behaviour is established through the internal environment of the state."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Material violence.\n\nPostcolonialism identifies three forms of violence: epistemic violence (the violence of imposing a dominant knowledge system), structural violence (the violence of social structures and institutions), and cultural or pervasive violence (the violence of cultural norms and practices).

Development inequalities and increasing marginalization of some ethnic or economic groups in the populations, alongside an increasing awareness of their dispossession provides grounds for breeding terrorism."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Terrorism is a complex phenomenon with various techniques and targets. Suicide attacks are one of the methods used by terrorists to maximize casualties and create fear.

It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study.

To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security.\n\nExplanation: The Commission on Human Security was launched with the primary objective of promoting human security as a policy priority, developing the concept as an operational tool, and proposing concrete actions to address critical threats.

Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nRealist opposition to humanitarian intervention is based on the assumption that states will protect their citizens (A). However, critics argue that this is not always the case, and that sovereignty does not absolve states of their responsibilities to their people (B).

All of these options."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Security dilemmas in the context of societal identity can be influenced by various factors, including nationalism. Ambiguity in nationalism can stem from both cultural and ethnic aspects. While cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures, ethnic nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration. However, the distinction between cultural and political nationalism is not always clear"}], [{"generated_text": " B. The security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists. Within this environment, states are obliged to seek security through their own military efforts; this is perceived as threatening to other states and so triggers an arms race spiral. The security dilemma has implications for security sectors other than the military, particularly the political and societal security sectors."}], [{"generated_text": " C. Arms control does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships.\n\nExplanation: Arms control as a strategic policy does challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system by focusing on reducing the number and types of weapons, and creating mechanisms for transparency and verification.

In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy."}], [{"generated_text": " B. Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Energy security is not only about the physical security of energy infrastructure but also encompasses economic, regime and international, environmental, and human security. Economic and development security are linked as energy is a major driver of economic growth and development. Regime and international security are linked as energy disputes and dependencies can lead to geopolitical tensions and conflicts.

International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime."}], [{"generated_text": " C. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: The exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat has significant implications beyond the military context. It is often based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationales that limit women's participation in civil society in other ways.
