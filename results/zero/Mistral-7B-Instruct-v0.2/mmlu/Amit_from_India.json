Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\nExplanation:\nThe question states that the owner had no reason to know that any of the meat was contaminated when he was out of the country.

Insufficient, because it is too vague."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation:\nIn an FOB (Free on Board) sale, the risk of loss or damage to the goods passes from the seller to the buyer when the goods are loaded on the carrier. However, in this case, the goods were destroyed before they were loaded on the carrier. Nevertheless, since the risk of loss had already passed to the buyer under the terms of the contract, the buyer can still recover from the seller for the breach of contract."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\n\nB.

An accessory before the fact helps in the planning or facilitation of a crime before it is committed. In this case, the defendant planned and executed the poisoning of his uncle's tea before the crime was committed.

Therefore, the defendant's culpability would most probably be as an accessory before the fact."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided in the question, the new federal statute is intended to apply to all leasehold contracts involving residential and commercial properties throughout the United States. Therefore, the most clearly constitutional application of the statute would be to a typical landlord-tenant relationship, such as the rental of an apartment by a real estate company to an individual tenant (Option C).
