The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n\nExplanation: The students' argument that the ordinance violates their equal protection rights is the weakest because the ordinance explicitly exempts religious singing from its prohibition.
