Primary.\n\nExplanation: Primary control refers to an individual or group having direct control over a specific area or issue.

This contradicts the idea that the same genes causing reproductive success also lead to aging."}], [{"generated_text": " C. Changes in hormone levels.

Negative impact. Older workers no longer need to prove negative impact to win a job discrimination suit, according to the Supreme Court ruling."}], [{"generated_text": " D. A severe loss of neural connections and decreased blood flow.\n\nExplanation: Working memory is the cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information. With advanced age, there is a decline in working memory capacity.

This results in a reduced ability to process and retain information in working memory."}], [{"generated_text": " B. Dependent.\n\nExplanation: Institutional care, such as nursing homes, can sometimes inadvertently promote a culture of dependency among older residents.

The prosecution is correct with respect to both the battery and assault charges.\n\nExplanation: In most jurisdictions, a mistake of fact is a valid defense to both assault and battery charges.

The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act. This speech act is presented to an audience by a securitizing actor. This actor attempts to convince that audience of the credibility of the issue as an existential threat to a specific referent object.

By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.\n\nExplanation: Constructivism does not neglect internationalization or the role of non-state actors in international relations. It emphasizes the importance of ideas, norms, and social constructs in shaping the identities and interests of actors, including states and non-state actors. Therefore, option C is not a valid criticism of constructivism."}], [{"generated_text": " D. Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives.

Game theory and deterrence theory as an intellectual development resulted in the trade-off between policy relevance/utility and theoretical abstraction/sophistication."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict."}], [{"generated_text": " B. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state."}], [{"generated_text": " C. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: The global economic crisis has presented several challenges to the liberalist perspective. The crisis has highlighted the failure of international cooperation and the inadequacy of market forces to prevent a global catastrophe.

The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n\nExplanation: The institutional innovation of security studies was largely driven by the broader political considerations of the Cold War era.

This required a more"}], [{"generated_text": " C. The Great Law is a challenge for traditional security studies, as it represents a proven non-state approach.\n\nExplanation: The Great Law of Peace, also known as the Iroquoian Constitution or the Haudenosaunee Constitution, is a historical political confederacy of the Iroquois Nations in North America. It is a decentralized political system that emphasizes consensus-building and diplomacy, rather than military force or centralized authority."}], [{"generated_text": " D. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians.

The behaviour of states is governed by their economic interests, in terms of securing favorable trade agreements and building strong domestic markets. Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Post-Cold War developments have led to an increase in globalization, political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism, and a sharp increase in civil conflicts.
