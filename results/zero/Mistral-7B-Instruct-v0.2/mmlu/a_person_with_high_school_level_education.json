A merchant writes buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000.\n\nExplanation: In order for an offer to be irrevocable, it must be explicitly stated as such and conditions must be met.

There is no case or controversy.\n\nExplanation:\nThis answer is the weakest defense for the city because there is a clear case or controversy.

However, a determination of guilt ultimately rests with a judge or jury, and additional evidence or considerations may come into play."}], [{"generated_text": " A. It has to result in an advisory opinion.\n\nExplanation: A federal court cannot issue an advisory opinion, meaning a decision that does not resolve a current dispute or controversy between parties.

Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari passu.\n\nExplanation: In some jurisdictions, the pari passu relationship between blood relatives allows for the enforcement of certain types of reasonable restraints on alienation, such as an automatic reverter.

Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the correct answer is B.

Deceit.\n\nExplanation: The defendant used deceit by misrepresenting the price of the game to the store, allowing him to purchase it for less than its actual value. This is a form of fraud.

In this case, the easement is granted to public utility companies for the use of a strip of land along the rear of each lot.

The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented."}], [{"generated_text": " A. In this scenario, the club president's statement could be considered defamatory towards the judge, as it implies that the judge has engaged in an illegal act (buying a judicial position).

No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself."}], [{"generated_text": " A. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nExplanation:\nThe parties have not reached an agreement on the price per acre of the land.

Since they have not agreed on a material term of the contract, no contract exists."}], [{"generated_text": " D. Equitable servitude(s)."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

This answer is based on the \"race notice\" recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction, which states that no conveyance is valid against purchasers who record first.

For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\n\nExplanation: The recording act in this question states that no unrecorded conveyance of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record. In this case, the cousin recorded her deed before the friend did, and the friend was not in possession when he received the deed from the man.

Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \"unduly risky\" policy provision in his case-in-chief."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation: The toxicologist's opinion about the cause of death based on experimental and not yet publishable methods, and the fact that succinylcholine was previously believed to be undetectable in the brain shortly after injection, raises significant concerns about the reliability and validity of his testimony.

In this case, the witness overheard the victim's statement just before she was found dead, indicating that she believed her death was imminent. Therefore, the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement would be admissible as a dying declaration under the circumstances."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n\nExplanation: The December 1 agreement was an oral modification of the original written contract, but it did not meet the requirements for a valid modification under contract law.
