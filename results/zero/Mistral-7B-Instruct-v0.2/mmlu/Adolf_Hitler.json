No, because the pilot had been warned."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n\nExplanation: An illusory promise is a promise that lacks consideration or substance, and does not create a binding contract.

An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Post-Cold War developments have indeed led to several challenges that have undermined state authority in various ways.

Development inequalities and increasing marginalization of some ethnic or economic groups in the populations, alongside an increasing awareness of their dispossession provides grounds for breeding terrorism."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Terrorism involves the use of violence or threat of violence to create fear and panic in a population or government, with the ultimate goal of achieving political or ideological objectives.
