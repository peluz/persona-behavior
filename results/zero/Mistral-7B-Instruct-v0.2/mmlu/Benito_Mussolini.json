All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Benito Mussolini, as a proponent of Fascism, held a critical view of capitalism.

The redistribution of wealth, addressing disparities in economic and resource allocation across the globe through a sense of greater 'interconnectedness'.\n\nExplanation: While globalization has brought about many positive outcomes, the redistribution of wealth and addressing economic disparities have not been consistent or equitable. Globalization has often led to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, exacerbating economic inequalities."}], [{"generated_text": " D. All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Extraordinary measures are those that go beyond the normal or regular measures taken by the state.

Therefore, the answer is D."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act.

By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.\n\nExplanation: Constructivism is a theoretical approach in International Relations that emphasizes the role of ideas, social norms, and identities in shaping international relations. It does not neglect internationalization or the role of non-state actors in a globalized world, but rather sees the state as a social construct that is shaped by these same ideas,"}], [{"generated_text": " D.
