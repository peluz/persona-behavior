Canada's first major migration came from France.\n\nExplanation: While France did contribute to Canadian migration, particularly in Quebec, the first major wave of settlers in Canada were actually from England.

A pocket veto.\n\nExplanation: If Congress passes a bill and adjourns for more than ten days without the president taking any action on it, the bill effectively dies, and this is known as a pocket veto.

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: The global economic crisis has posed significant challenges to the liberalist perspective in various ways.

The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n\nExplanation: The Cold War era and the proliferation of nuclear weapons necessitated a shift from tactical operations to long-term strategy.
