The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism.

The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n\nExplanation: During the Cold War, the institutional innovation of security studies was facilitated by the need for a long-term strategy to deal with the political implications of the nuclear arms race and the potential for large-scale conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.

The behaviour of states is governed by their economic interests, in terms of securing favorable trade agreements and building strong domestic markets. Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

Engagement of military forces to expel certain social groups from within a state.\n\nExplanation: The other statements (A, B, and D) are strategies or approaches that can be used to preserve or strengthen cultural values, boost nationalist interests, or allow for peaceful separation, respectively.

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Post-Cold War developments have indeed led to various challenges that have undermined state authority in different ways.

Realism is defined by the belief that the behaviour of states constructs the international arena and that this behaviour is established through the internal environment of the state."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Material violence.\n\nExplanation: Postcolonialism identifies three forms of violence: epistemic violence (the violence of knowledge and representation), structural violence (the violence of systems and institutions), and cultural or symbolic violence (the violence of language and representation).

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Terrorism is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, and there is no single definition that fully captures its essence.
