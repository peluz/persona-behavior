The landowner is entitled to a mandatory injunction requiring the developer to restore conditions to those existing with the prior building insofar as the shadow is concerned."}], [{"generated_text": " A. In this scenario, the state regulation is likely constitutional. The employee does have a constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion, but the state may impose reasonable regulations that are rationally related to the furtherance of a state interest.

Gender\n\nExplanation: The strict scrutiny standard of review is a judicial test used in the United States to evaluate the constitutionality of laws that burden fundamental rights or suspect classes. This standard requires that the government have a compelling interest and that the law be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Gender is considered a suspect classification under intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny.

Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The defendant in situation C had a duty to render aid to the victim, as a physician.
