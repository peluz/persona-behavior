In this case, France requires fewer labor hours to produce a unit of cheese compared to Belgium, indicating that France has a comparative advantage in cheese production."}], [{"generated_text": " C. includes structural and cyclical unemployment.\n\nExplanation: The natural rate of unemployment refers to the level of unemployment that exists in an economy when it is operating at full employment.

Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.

The applicability of duress to arson or murder is a separate legal issue and is not directly related to the question at hand."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The defense of necessity may be most likely to exculpate the defendant in situation D, as the defendant was faced with a choice between two evils: being killed by the robbers or causing harm to an innocent bystander.
