No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the answer is D. assault and attempted larceny. The customer attempted to take the gun, which is a form of larceny, and also threatened the owner with the gun, which is a form of assault."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the answer would be: B. guilty, because he intended to steal the baseball.\n\nExplanation: The defendant's actions of crashing the party and wandering through the house do not necessarily make him guilty of burglary. However, his intent to steal the baseball once he found it in the glass case is the key factor that makes him guilty of burglary. Burglary is defined as entering a building with the intent to commit"}], [{"generated_text": " D. No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided in the question, the answer is:\n\nB. The investor.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe recording act in this jurisdiction states that every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. In this case, the investor recorded his deed in 1998, while the other parties did not record their deeds"}], [{"generated_text": " D.

The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\n\nExplanation:\nThe farmer's promise to survey the 10-acre tract was an oral agreement that was not included in the written lease.

During the daytime.\n\nExplanation: Common law burglary is a legal concept that refers to breaking and entering into a dwelling (a building where people live) with the intent to commit a felony therein. The key elements are a breaking and entry into a dwelling and the intent to commit a felony. The time of day is not a factor in common law burglary."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The defendant's actions in situations A and D do not directly result in a murder. In situation B, the defendant did not cause the death, but rather his girlfriend did. However, in situation C, the defendant was driving recklessly and with knowledge of his car's defective brakes, which directly contributed to the death of the victim."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death."}], [{"generated_text": " D. not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury."}], [{"generated_text": " A."}], [{"generated_text": " A. prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present."}], [{"generated_text": " D. guilty, because she did not consent, and his belief that she was consenting was unreasonable.\n\nExplanation: In this case, the focus is on the victim's lack of consent, not the defendant's intent or belief. Rape is a crime that requires proof of non-consent, not intent. The defendant's intoxication and mistaken belief do not negate the victim's lack of consent. Therefore, the answer is"}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the answer would be:\n\nD. the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Parol Evidence Rule is a legal doctrine that prevents parties from introducing evidence outside of a written contract to modify or contradict the terms of the written contract, if the contract is intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement.

In situation D, the defendant's intoxication would not negate his criminal culpability for statutory rape because the victim's age is a clear legal standard that does not depend on the defendant's state of intoxication."}], [{"generated_text": " C. When it's not offered to prove the contents of the document."}], [{"generated_text": " D. abstain from jurisdiction because the constitutional issue should be litigated first in a state court."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

However, if the jurisdiction permits the furniture"}], [{"generated_text": " A. The man and the woman are guilty of conspiracy and larceny."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\n\nExplanation: The intoxication defense may be raised when a defendant claims that they were so intoxicated that they lacked the mental capacity to form the specific intent required for the crime charged.
