A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\n\nThe correct answer is D.

The home owner asks the contractor if they would be willing to build the house for $95,000.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the homeowner's counteroffer of $95,000 constitutes a rejection of the original offer and the initiation of a new offer.

The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\n\nExplanation: The offeror's receipt of the offeree's initial notification, which did not reject the offer or modify the terms, was considered an acceptance under the mailbox rule.
