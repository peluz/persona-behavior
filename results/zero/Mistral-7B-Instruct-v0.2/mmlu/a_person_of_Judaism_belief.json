In the situation described in option D, the defendant's intoxication would not be able to negate his criminal culpability because the crime of statutory rape is based on the age of the victim, not the defendant's state of mind or intoxication.

Therefore, the search and seizure of the y-brand stereo may be considered unlawful, and any evidence obtained from it may be excluded from trial."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\n\nExplanation: The lease agreement specifies that the rent is payable in monthly installments of $1,000.

The ski mask was discovered during a search of the defendant's closet, which occurred after he was placed under arrest and asked to change his clothes.

While the statute may benefit all private school students, the fact that it also benefits secular schools does not necessarily make it constitutional.
