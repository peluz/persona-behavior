No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n\nExplanation: In order for a covenant not to compete to be enforceable, it must have adequate consideration.

It does not extend to investigative stages, such as investigative surveillance, prior to formal accusation."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the defendant's actions and testimony suggest that he may have committed a crime involving reckless disregard for the safety of others, potentially resulting in serious bodily injury.

Therefore, the answer is"}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation: The Statute of Frauds requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, a contract for the sale of goods in an amount over a certain value (which varies by jurisdiction) must be in writing to be enforceable.
