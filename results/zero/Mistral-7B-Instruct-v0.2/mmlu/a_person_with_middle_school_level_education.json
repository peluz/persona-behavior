The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time."}], [{"generated_text": " C. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the defendant's conduct is most likely to make him criminally responsible for the victim's death in situation B.

The state has the highest unemployment rate in the country.\n\nThis argument is the most compelling because it directly relates to the primary purpose of the statute, which is to help alleviate the state's high rate of unemployment.

The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.\n\nExplanation: The First Amendment protects not only political speech but also ideas and theories, regardless of whether they are popular or not. The man's proposed lecture, even if not political, is still protected speech under the First Amendment."}], [{"generated_text": " C. inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character."}], [{"generated_text": " A."}], [{"generated_text": " C. No duty for natural conditions.\n\nExplanation:\nUnder common law principles, a possessor of land owes a duty to an undiscovered trespasser for any natural conditions on the land that could pose a risk of harm.

The state's argument that the statute benefits all children in private schools, religious and nonreligious, is the least persuasive.

The student's suspension did not constitute a denial of due process.\n\nExplanation:\nThe student's suspension does not deprive him of a liberty or property interest without due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment because the right to attend school is not a fundamental right and the student was not expelled permanently.

The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n\nExplanation: Since the question states that the contract was made over the phone and there is no mention of it being in writing, it is considered an oral contract. For a contract involving a significant amount of money, such as $10,000 for roof repairs, it is generally recommended to have a written contract to ensure enforceability."}], [{"generated_text": " B. The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation:\nThe distribution agreement stated that the distributor's acceptance of the retailer's orders was required before they became binding.
