It is recommended that legal advice is sought for a more accurate determination."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, the best answer is B.

Yes, because the law of attempt requires more substantial action toward the completion of the crimes then the accused men accomplished under these facts."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The man did not intend to commit a crime inside the house.\n\nExplanation: The man entered the house without force (since the door was unlocked) and with the intent to retrieve his own property, not to commit a crime inside the house. This could potentially be considered a trespassing charge, but not a burglary charge. Burglary requires the intent to commit a crime inside the building."}], [{"generated_text": " Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the defendant is guilty of A. Voluntary Manslaughter. The defendant's intoxication may have impaired his ability to form the specific intent required for first degree murder, but his actions were still deliberate and intentional, making voluntary manslaughter a more likely charge.

The photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs is not the least accurate statement.

The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\n\nExplanation:\nThe contract explicitly states that the monies due under the contract shall not be assignable.

No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The supremacy clause invalidates the state law, because there is federal legislation regulating pension and profit sharing plans.\n\nExplanation:\nThe supremacy clause of the United States Constitution states that federal law is the supreme law of the land and takes precedence over state laws. In this case, the attorney could argue that there is existing federal legislation that regulates pension and profit sharing plans, and the new state law conflicts with and is preempted by that"}], [{"generated_text": " D.

Robbery and attempted murder.\n\nExplanation: The perpetrator committed the crime of robbery by taking the money from the victim using force or the threat of force. The attempt to enter the apartment without consent before the robbery occurred could potentially be considered burglary, but since the question asks for the probable common law crimes committed after the man was accosted in his apartment, the answer focuses on the robbery and the threat of violence ("}], [{"generated_text": " A. Insufficient, because it is too vague."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation:\nIn an FOB (Free on Board) sale, the risk of loss or damage to the goods passes from the seller to the buyer when the goods have been loaded on the carrier.

The child.\n\nExplanation: In most jurisdictions, a child can bring a claim for injuries sustained before birth if they are born alive.

There is no right to Miranda warnings."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n\nExplanation: The student's argument is that he was denied due process because he was not given notice or a hearing before the financial aid was terminated. Fact D would be most helpful to the student if it were true because it would show that the university did in fact provide the student with notice of the hearing, which would weaken the student's due process argument.

For the woman, because the use was changed by the men while they were in possession.\n\nExplanation: Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows a person to acquire title to real property through open, notorious, continuous, and hostile possession for the statutory period.
