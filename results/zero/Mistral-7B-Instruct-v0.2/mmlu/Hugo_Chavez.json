The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination. This is because eminent domain is a power of the government to take private property for public use, and it is typically exercised by public authorities, not private corporations. The legislative determination ensures that the taking is for a legitimate public use."}], [{"generated_text": " A."}], [{"generated_text": " B.

No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process."}], [{"generated_text": " A. \n\nExplanation: The instruction given to the jury, \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,\" could be perceived as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder, rather than a permissible inference. This could potentially have taken the fact-finding task of determining criminal intent out of the jury's hands, making the conviction susceptible to reversal by the United States Supreme Court."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Larceny.\n\nExplanation: The defendant took property (money or baked bread) belonging to the husband and wife without their consent. This is the essential element of larceny. The fact that the defendant was attempting to enter the store through the back window does not change the nature of the crime, as the attempt to commit a burglary was unsuccessful. Therefore, the defendant will most likely be convicted of larceny."}], [{"generated_text": " C. not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt."}], [{"generated_text": " A. granted, because the police did not have a warrant to search their car."}], [{"generated_text": " C. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception."}], [{"generated_text": " C.

The gift violates the establishment clause."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation: In the United States, the doctrine of double jeopardy prevents a defendant from being tried twice for the same offense. Since the city and state are seeking to prosecute the defendant for the same incident, and since jeopardy attached in the first prosecution (as evidenced by the granting of a mistrial), the defendant is entitled to have the second prosecution dismissed."}], [{"generated_text": " B. No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable."}], [{"generated_text": " D.

If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer."}], [{"generated_text": " A.

They can include the use of force or violence, responses to existential threats, and actions that exist outside the usual political realm."}], [{"generated_text": " D. The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act. This speech act is presented to an audience by a securitizing actor.

The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism.

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: The recent global economic crisis has presented several challenges to the liberalist perspective. One challenge is the increase in governmental cyberspace restrictions, as some countries have used the crisis as an opportunity to tighten control over the internet and monitor online activities. Another challenge is the failure of international cooperation to prevent the crisis, which has led to massive economic collapse and contagion.

All of these options.\n\nExplanation: Post-Cold War developments have led to an increase in globalization, political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism, and a sharp increase in civil conflicts.
