Entitlement programs.\n\nExplanation: Entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, make up a significant portion of the federal budget and are considered \"automatic spending\" because they are mandatory and do not require annual appropriations from Congress.

A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party."}], [{"generated_text": " A. Proliferation of many small parties.\n\nExplanation: In a single-member district electoral system, each district elects only one representative. This can make it difficult for smaller parties to gain representation, as they may not be able to win in enough districts to form a significant bloc in Congress. As a result, single-member district systems often lead to the dominance of larger parties and the proliferation of many small parties."}], [{"generated_text": " C. granted African-Americans the right to vote"}], [{"generated_text": " A. determines both the rules of the House and conditions for legislative process."}], [{"generated_text": " C. orders the lower court to retry the case"}], [{"generated_text": " C.
