Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest."}], [{"generated_text": " The answer is: B. Robbery and attempted murder.\n\nExplanation: The perpetrator committed the crime of robbery by taking the money from the victim using force or the threat of force. The attempt to murder is inferred from the use of a gun and the threat to use it against the victim.

Insufficient, because it is too vague."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the contract specified that the risk of loss was on the seller (FOB at the seller's place of business).

The fact that the grocer was also a fraud victim and suffered a substantial financial loss does not affect the buyer's rights to the property"}], [{"generated_text": " B.

In this scenario, the officer had no reasonable suspicion to justify the search of the car beyond the traffic violation. The presence of stolen property discovered during the search does not retroactively make the search lawful.

The university has signed a stipulation agreeing not to harass her in the future.

Therefore, the answer is A. guilty."}], [{"generated_text": " A.\n\nExplanation: The defendant breached her contractual obligation to pay for the parking fee when she refused to pay and drove her car home without authorization from the parking attendant.

The son's not succeeding, because he could not convey marketable title."}], [{"generated_text": " C. The proprietor subjectively believed that the man understood that the proprietor would only be obligated to pay a set fee for each mile covered during the charity run (D is similar but focuses on the proprietor's belief, while C focuses on the man's knowledge).

The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\n\nExplanation:\n\nConspiracy occurs when two or more people agree to commit a crime. In this case, the two men agreed to burglarize the home, making them guilty of conspiracy.

Ignorance or Mistake\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the man was unaware that the punch contained PCP, which led him to commit the crime. The defense of \"Ignorance or Mistake\" could potentially be successful as it requires the defendant to have lacked knowledge of the facts or circumstances that established the element of the crime.

The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\n\nExplanation:\nAssault with intent to commit rape is a specific intent crime, meaning that the defendant must have the specific intent to commit rape at the time of the assault.
