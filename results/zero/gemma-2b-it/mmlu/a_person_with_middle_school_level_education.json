This prevents them from becoming too swollen and lysed (bursting)."}], [{"generated_text": "C. Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA\n\nPrimers are required when performing a polymerase chain reaction (P C R) on a DNA sample because they provide the starting points for DNA polymerase to extend the DNA strands."}], [{"generated_text": "C. Genetic drift\n\nExplanation: Genetic drift is a random fluctuation in allele frequencies that can occur in small populations more readily than in large populations. This is because in small populations, there is a greater chance that a random mutation will occur that will fix in the population. In large populations, the effects of genetic drift are averaged out, making it less likely that a particular allele will be fixed or eliminated."}], [{"generated_text": "A. new mutations that occurred in the preceding generation.\n\nExplanation: Mutations can occur in genes, leading to new variations in the DNA sequence. These mutations can be caused by various factors, including exposure to environmental toxins, radiation, or errors during DNA replication.

As you drive from east to west in the U.S., the availability of water becomes increasingly limited, which causes the forest to transition to a grassland ecosystem."}], [{"generated_text": "B. Transcription factors mediate the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription, which will determine how much protein is manufactured."}], [{"generated_text": "D. meiosis\n\nMeiosis is a mode of sexual reproduction that involves the pairing and exchange of genetic material between two gametes, resulting in offspring that are genetically different from both parents."}], [{"generated_text": "A. The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for black.\n\nExplanation: Since the offspring have a 7:8:17 ratio of colors, it suggests that there are three genes involved, each controlling one color. The gray color is dominant, the black color is recessive, and the white color is an intermediate phenotype. Therefore, the gray gene masks the black gene, resulting in the observed color pattern."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Most CO2 produced during cellular respiration is released from glycolysis.\n\nExplanation: During cellular respiration, the final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is the electron carrier NAD+. The electron carrier passes its electrons to the electron transport chain, where they are used to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane. This creates a proton gradient, which is used to generate ATP through ATP synthase."}], [{"generated_text": "C.
