Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\n\nExplanation: The passage describes a situation where the serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range despite the absence of additional food or drink for 12 hours. This suggests that the primary mechanism responsible for maintaining this glucose level is the continued absorption of calories from the ingested meal through the gut."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Bacterial meningitis\n\nExplanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the seizure, headache, cough, fever, and neurological deficits, is consistent with bacterial meningitis. The MRI findings of bitemporal hyperintensities are also consistent with bacterial meningitis."}], [{"generated_text": "A.

When the efferent arteriole is constricted, the filtration coefficient will decrease because the resistance to fluid flow will increase."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Development of natural killer cells\n\nExplanation: Rho A immune globulin is most likely to prevent the development of natural killer cells. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that is responsible for killing infected cells and cancer cells.
