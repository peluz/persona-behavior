Avascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\nExplanation: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a vascular disorder that is caused by a lack of blood flow to the tissues. The patient's pain in the legs that increases with weight-bearing is a classic symptom of vascular necrosis."}], [{"generated_text": "A.

Cryptosporidium parvum\n\nExplanation: Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that is commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and water. It is a known cause of gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and weight loss. The patient's travel history to areas where Cryptosporidium is endemic further supports the diagnosis."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\n\nExplanation: The gut absorbs glucose from the ingested meal, contributing to the rise in serum glucose concentration. When the man sleeps, the gut is inactive, and the absorption of glucose is minimal. Therefore, the mechanism most likely involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration is the continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal."}], [{"generated_text": "B.

Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)\n\nThe filtration coefficient (Kf) is a measure of the rate at which fluid and solute are filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the renal tubule. When the efferent arteriole is constricted, the filtration coefficient will decrease because the resistance to fluid flow will increase."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Development of natural killer cells\n\nExplanation: Rho A immune globulin is most likely to prevent the development of natural killer cells. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that is responsible for killing infected cells and cancer cells. Rho A immune globulin binds to the Rh antigen on the surface of red blood cells and prevents the activation of natural killer cells."}], [{"generated_text": "A.
