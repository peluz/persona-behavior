Latanoprost\n\nLatanoprost is a drug used to treat glaucoma and other eye conditions. It is a prostaglandin receptor antagonist, which means that it blocks the effects of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that are released by cells to regulate blood flow and other bodily functions. When prostaglandins are blocked, it can help to improve blood flow and reduce intraocular pressure. However, when used for glaucoma, latanoprost can also cause side effects such as shortness of breath,"}], [{"generated_text": "B.
