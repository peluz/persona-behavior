In small populations, genetic drift can therefore have a significant impact on gene frequencies, even if the mutation rate is low."}], [{"generated_text": "A. new mutations that occurred in the preceding generation.\n\nExplanation: Mutations occur randomly in the DNA of each cell, and new mutations can arise in any cell in any generation. These mutations can then be passed on to offspring, contributing to genetic variation."}], [{"generated_text": "A.

Availability of water\n\nThe availability of water is the critical factor responsible for the shift in the ecosystem. As you drive from east to west in the U.S., the availability of water becomes increasingly limited.
