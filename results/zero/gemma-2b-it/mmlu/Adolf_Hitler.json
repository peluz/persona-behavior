The promotion of human security and the affiliated environmental security as a priority within oil-producing states."}], [{"generated_text": "D. All of these options.\n\nThe passage argues that the case for humanitarian intervention is limited by the fact that it is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights, that advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights, and that any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states."}], [{"generated_text": "C.
