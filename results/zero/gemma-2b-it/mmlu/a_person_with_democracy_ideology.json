It is expressed in high levels in endothelial cells, and its overexpression can lead to the formation of blood clots. In this case, the presence of a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound suggests that the patient may have sustained a blood clot in the leg"}], [{"generated_text": "B. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD\n\nExplanation: A carrier is an individual who carries a genetic mutation but does not express the disease symptoms themselves. Carriers can pass on the mutation to their children, increasing the risk of the disease in their offspring. In this case, the patient's mother's serum muscle creatine kinase concentration is elevated, indicating that she is a carrier of the DMD gene."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Call her previous physician to obtain more history.\n\nThe physician needs to obtain more history from the parents, including the reason for the PPD skin test, the parents' medical history, and any previous medical tests or screenings.

Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue\n\nThe patient presents with a 2-week history of black discharge from the right nipple, which is concerning for potential malignancy. An excisional biopsy of the suspected mass is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to confirm the presence of cancerous tissue and determine the appropriate management strategy."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Cryptosporidium parvum\n\nExplanation: Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that is commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and water. It is a known cause of gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and weight loss.

Granulosa tumor\n\nThe most likely answer is a granulosa tumor, which is a benign tumor of the female reproductive tract."}], [{"generated_text": "B. aortic stenosis\n\nAortic stenosis would be the most likely cause of the syncopal event, as it would result in a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which could lead to a stroke."}], [{"generated_text": "C. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes\n\nThe most appropriate treatment would be to debride the necrotic skin over the toes to remove the dead tissue and promote healing."}], [{"generated_text": "D. Spondylolisthesis\n\nExplanation: A spondylolisthesis is a condition in which the spine curves abnormally, putting pressure on the nerves and muscles in the lower back. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Disruption of vascular basement membranes\n\nExplanation: Disruption of vascular basement membranes allows fluid and protein to leak out of blood vessels, leading to swelling and increased permeability."}], [{"generated_text": "C.

The patient's perception that the physician is incompetent"}], [{"generated_text": "A. Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)\n\nThe filtration coefficient (Kf) is a measure of the rate at which fluid and solute are filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the renal tubule. When the efferent arteriole is constricted, the filtration coefficient will decrease because the resistance to fluid flow will increase."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Development of natural killer cells\n\nThe physician recommends administration of Rho A. immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent the development of natural killer cells."}], [{"generated_text": "A. Acute bacterial endocarditis\n\nExplanation: Bacterial endocarditis is a rare but serious infection of the heart valves.
