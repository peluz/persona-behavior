The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.\n\nThe trial court most likely ruled that the intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability. The intervening causes were evidence that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures.
