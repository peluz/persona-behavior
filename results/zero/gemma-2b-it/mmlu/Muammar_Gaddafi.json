Without peace everyone has a right to everything - including another's life.\n\nAccording to Hobbes, peace is the first law of nature because it is the foundation upon which all other human rights and freedoms can be built.

Specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence.\n\nThe judge will be most likely to sustain this objection, as it prevents the prosecution from presenting evidence from other sources, such as the confession itself, to contradict Bobbie-Sue's testimony."}], [{"generated_text": "C. The materials in the bar review course had recently been reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and had received \"high acclaim. \"\n\nThe graduate's claim that she was fired for insubordination is likely to be weakened by the fact that the materials she was required to review were highly acclaimed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education."}], [{"generated_text": "A. the bartender.\n\nAs the owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction, the bartender is the person who has the burden of proving title by clear and convincing evidence.

In this case, the right of the logging company to cut and sell the timber that was to be cleared from the tract is an easement appurtenant to the right granted by the director to the logging company to cut timber."}], [{"generated_text": "C. Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\n\nThe contract is ambiguous on the issue of whether the work would be completed in 60 days. The contract does not specify a time of completion, and the parties did not specify that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days in the written contract.

The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable."}], [{"generated_text": "C. Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment requires that any search or seizure must be based on a warrant issued by a judicial officer. The officers did not have a warrant for the house, so they cannot search it without a warrant."}], [{"generated_text": "A. nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.\n\nThe buyer did not consent to the assignment, so the seller has the right to reject the assignment."}], [{"generated_text": "A. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the woman was negligent on this occasion."}], [{"generated_text": "A. win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous."}], [{"generated_text": "C.
