I III and IV only\n\nThe correct answer is that I, III and IV only hold true in the context of classical economics. Say's law states that the supply of a good or service will equal its demand, which is a fundamental principle of supply and demand theory. Input and output prices will stay in line with each other when supply and demand are equal. The government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level, as this is not a relevant factor in classical economics."}], [{"generated_text": "B.
