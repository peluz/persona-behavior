Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\n\nExplanation: The passage describes a situation where the serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range despite the absence of additional food or drink for 12 hours.

The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism.
