Extremely racist. The comment makes a derogatory generalization about black people, using stereotypes and dehumanizing language."}], [{"generated_text": " This tweet is (4) Very racist. By implying that Polish is a \"vile language\" and suggesting that there is no reason to offer Polish lessons, the tweet is expressing a negative attitude towards Polish people and their culture. This is a form of racial or ethnic discrimination, as it is based on the idea that one group is inferior to another. The tweet is not the most extreme form of racism, but it is still a clear expression of prejudice and discrimination."}], [{"generated_text": " (2) Slightly racist\n\nThe statement shows a lack of understanding and sensitivity towards the use of derogatory terms and hate speech.
