However, it does perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and objectifies women, implying that they are only valuable for their sexuality and for fulfilling men's desires.

The comparison of a group of people to non-human primates is a well-known racist trope, and the tweet's suggestion that a \"large dark section of the population\" did not make a certain evolutionary split is implying a racial hierarchy.
