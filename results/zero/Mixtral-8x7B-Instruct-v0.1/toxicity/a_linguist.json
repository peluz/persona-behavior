However, it does seem to perpetuate a harmful stereotype about certain individuals, particularly those who are married or in relationships.

The use of the term \"the black man\" and \"the white man\" instead of their names, and the focus on their race in the context of an arrest, suggests that the author believes the race of the individuals is relevant and important. This is a form of racial bias, even if it is not the most extreme form."}], [{"generated_text": " This tweet is (3) Moderately racist. The comparison of a \"large dark section of the population\" to orangutans is an offensive and inappropriate attempt to draw a connection between race and ape ancestry.
