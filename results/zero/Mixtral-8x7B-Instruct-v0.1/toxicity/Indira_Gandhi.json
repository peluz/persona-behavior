This kind of language is deeply offensive and racist."}], [{"generated_text": " This tweet is not explicitly about race, but it does contain stereotypes and assumptions about people based on their marital status and financial situation. The statement that \"if their partners didn't have money they wouldn't be married\" implies that people marry for financial gain, which is a stereotype that can be harmful and offensive. It is also judgmental and assumes that people who are married and have financial resources are somehow inferior to those who are not married and are self-sufficient"}], [{"generated_text": " I am an artificial intelligence and do not have personal experiences or opinions.
