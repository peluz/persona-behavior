This kind of language is unacceptable and has no place in any kind of discourse."}], [{"generated_text": " This tweet is (4) Very racist. The comment about Polish lessons being \"vile\" is a negative characterization of the Polish language and culture. This type of comment is often used to dehumanize and marginalize people based on their nationality or ethnicity, which is a form of racism."}], [{"generated_text": " (1) Not at all racist\n\nThe tweet does not contain any racial slurs or make any generalizations about a particular race. The term \"burn a fag\" is a phrase used to refer to burning a cigarette, and the term \"bum\" in this context is referring to asking someone for a light to start a cigarette. Therefore, the tweet is not racist."}]]
