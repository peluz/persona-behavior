The term 'AD' is derived from the Latin 'Anno Domini,' which means 'in the year of our Lord.' It is used to label the years after the birth of Jesus Christ, not after his death, so C is not correct.

There is no machine that can accurately tell if someone is lying.\n\nWhile polygraph and lie detector tests are often used in attempts to determine if someone is lying, it's important to note that these tests do not actually detect lies.
