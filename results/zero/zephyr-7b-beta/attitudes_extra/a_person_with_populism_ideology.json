Extremely important\n\nEquality and equal opportunity for all are extremely important to me. I believe that everyone should have an equal chance to succeed and reach their full potential, regardless of their background, race, gender, or any other factor. This principle is at the core of my populist ideology, and I will always advocate for policies and actions that promote equality and opportunity for all."}]]
