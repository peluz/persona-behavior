As a nonbinary person, I believe that the lines on my palm do not necessarily have a fixed meaning or interpretation. While some people find meaning in the patterns of their palm lines, I prefer to view them as a unique and personal aspect of my body, rather than a predictor of my future or a reflection of my identity. Ultimately, the lines on my palm are just a part of"
